    "text": "What is being a data scientist about?\nA data scientist is about transforming raw data into meaning. A data scientist cleans raw data and gathers insights through analysis . Data scientists discover patterns in data through modeling and inference. A data scientist’s goal can be to summarize and explore a data set, compare different groups, find an optimal business solution, use regression to project a numerical value, predict the classification of a new observation, and so much more! A data scientist must also be skilled in communicating their findings.\n\n\nData Scientists vs Statisticians - Differences/Similarities\nData scientists and statisticians both gather meaningful insights from data to help organizations solve problems, but their focuses are slightly different.\nStatistician\n\nMainly focuses on modeling\nData is relatively small in size and clean in text file formats.\nWork with mostly structured data\nBring data to models\n\nData Scientist\n\nMainly focuses on business problem and result\nWork with messy and large amounts of data in various formats\nWork with structured and unstructured data\nBring models to data\n\n\n\nHow do I view myself in relation to these two areas?\nI don’t currently view myself as either of these, but I am most interested in becoming a data scientist. So far in my graduate classes, I have enjoyed learning programming languages and learning all the ways to clean and explore data sets. I also think those two areas overlap. I still need to have a solid foundation in statistical analysis to be a successful data scientist.\n\n\nIris Dataset\nCreate object y.\n\ny &lt;- density(iris$Petal.Width)\n\nDetermine the class, type, and structure of object y.\n\nclass(y)\n\n[1] \"density\"\n\ntypeof(y)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\nstr(y)\n\nList of 8\n $ x         : num [1:512] -0.656 -0.648 -0.64 -0.633 -0.625 ...\n $ y         : num [1:512] 0.00161 0.00178 0.00197 0.00217 0.00239 ...\n $ bw        : num 0.252\n $ n         : int 150\n $ old.coords: logi FALSE\n $ call      : language density.default(x = iris$Petal.Width)\n $ data.name : chr \"iris$Petal.Width\"\n $ has.na    : logi FALSE\n - attr(*, \"class\")= chr \"density\"\n\n\nUse the plot function on y and hide the R code."
